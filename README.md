# Image-to-code-suite

Suite of tools for manipulating code and images

# Description

`gif-to-code.py` converts your gif into pure, unformatted code that displays the gif in your terminal
`code-and-picture-to-ascii.py` takes a code and reference image and formats the code into the shape of the image.

# Longer description

Ever wanted to turn a gif into animated ascii characters in your terminal or asciify your python art?

With the tools here, you can now take an input image and shape your code into your desired shape. 

Some caveats:

1. Code has to be packed, so it will look like some random characters. It won't be like c ascii art as python does not have it's single line code and multiline comments functionalities.

2. The run gif code is slow as it has to unpack the code, there can be some optimizations done, but I am out of ideas.
